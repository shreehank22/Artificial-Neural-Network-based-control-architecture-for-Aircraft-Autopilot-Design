# ✈️ Artificial Neural Network-Based Control Architecture for Aircraft Autopilot Design

This repository presents a **robust autopilot design** for aircraft using **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)** as controllers. The research explores the potential of neural networks to replace traditional PID controllers in **nonlinear flight control systems**, allowing the system to adapt and maintain performance in varying flight conditions.

## 📌 Key Highlights

* ✅ Developed an **ANN-based controller** to replicate and eventually replace PID control behavior
* ✅ Trained the ANN using data from a conventional **PID-controlled autopilot system**
* ✅ Demonstrated the ANN’s ability to adapt to **nonlinear aircraft dynamics**
* ✅ Validated performance through MATLAB/Simulink simulation
* ✅ Offers a scalable, intelligent alternative to classic control techniques

## 🧠 Methodology Overview

1. **System Setup:**

   * Modeled an aircraft autopilot control system in Simulink.
   * Initially used a conventional **PID controller** for attitude and altitude control.

2. **ANN Training:**

   * Generated a dataset by logging input-output pairs from the PID-controlled system.
   * Trained a **feedforward ANN** to learn the control policy.

3. **Controller Substitution:**

   * Replaced the PID controller with the trained ANN in the closed-loop feedback structure.
   * Evaluated system stability, tracking accuracy, and adaptability to nonlinearities.

4. **Simulation and Validation:**

   * Verified ANN-based controller performance under various flight scenarios in Simulink.
